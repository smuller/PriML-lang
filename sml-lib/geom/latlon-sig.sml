    (* Very simple projection where meridians and parallels are equally
       spaced straight lines. Does not preserve much of anything, but decent
       for local maps. Argument is the parallel (in degrees) where the scale
       is not distorted. For local maps, set this to a parallel within that
       region.
       Range is x: [-pi to +pi] and y: [-pi/2 to +pi/2].

       This projects both hemispheres atop one another (the center point and
       its antipode will both be projected to 0,0). The map is highly distorted
       in area except near the tangent point and its antipode, but all great
       circles are straight lines.
       Range is x: [-inf to +inf] and y: [-inf to +inf].

       transverse mercator (uses parallel rather than meridian)

       Actually it would be useful to be able to set a reference point
       and then behave as though that is 0,0 in projections.

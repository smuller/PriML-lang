(* "Quadtree" doesn't seem to describe one specific data structure. I
   use the term suggestively here. The data structure is my own design
   (though I think obvious). (XXX I found out this is basically a
   kd-tree.) There are two kinds of trees: horizontally- and
   vertically-split. A node in each kind of tree is either empty or a
   point. If it is a point, then it has two children. For
   horizontally-split trees, the left child is a vertically-split tree
   with all points therein being to the west of (or colinear) with the
   point at this node; and the right child with all points (strictly)
   to the east. Vertically-split nodes have horizontal trees as
   children, but of course split into north and south parts. (I'm
   describing a y axis where north trends towards negative infinity,
   as is common in computer graphics. This doesn't affect the client
   interface in any way.)

   This structure doesn't attempt to be smart about the splitting
   direction; it is wasteful when all the points lie on a line, or
   when their horizontal and vertical dispersion is not the same.
   Also, like other naive binary trees, it is not necessarily balanced
   and so certain sequences of insertions will produce trees that have
   linear-time lookups.

   XXX: It would be easy to generalize this to n-dimensions, though
   keeping the specialized two-dimensional one around is probably good
   for simplicity and efficiency.

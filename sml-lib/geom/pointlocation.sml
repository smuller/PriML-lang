(* This is a naive implementation. For every point test,
   we test it against each polygon's axis-aligned bounding
   box, then do a point inclusion test. For maps without
   a lot of regions, this is reasonable. For large inputs and
   some contrived cases it is atrocious. There are log(n)
   time, O(n) space algorithms that should be implemented in
   place of this one. For a survey,

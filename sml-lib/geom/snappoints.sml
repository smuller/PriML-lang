  (* The only thing tricky is treating epsilon; in order to make sure
     that there are no sliver-sized gaps (or overlaps) between
     polygons we want to merge their vertices when they are close. We
     also want to be careful that the result is not influenced by any
     arbitrary decision (such as the order in which we process points
     or polygons) in the input.

     In particular, we want "within-epsilon" to be an equivalence
     relation on vertices. If we are not careful, we have a situation
     like

        * -e- * -e- * -e- *
        A     B     C     D

     Where A is epsilon away from B, B epsilon away from C, etc., but
     A is more than epsilon away from D. Depending on the order we
     insert these points and canonicalize them, we could get several
     different arrangements. Instead, we start by building equivalence
     classes of points. Each point starts in its own equivalence
     class. We then iterate over every point point p, enumerate the
     points p' close to p (but in different polygons), then force p
     and p' into the same equivalence class. Oh urg, this has a
     problem. Suppose we have

        A -e- B

     where A and B are in different polygons. So we union them.

        A =e= B

     and then we also have

        C -e- D

     which we union

        A =e= B
          \
           e
            \
        C =e= D

     oh check it out A and D are also within epsilon.

        A =e= B
          \\
           e
            \\
        C =e= D

     Oh oops, turns out A and C are vertices on the same polygon. Now
     A and C have been collapsed to the same point. If we want this to
     be insensitive to insertion order we really are forced to do
     that. OK so we do that and then if polygons become degenerate or
     non-simple then we raise an exception afterwards, fine.

     Once we've normalized to equivalence classes, we just pick a
     canonical coordinate for each class, and use that when we store
     the polygons. Done.

     Here's an alternative: Take all pairs of points A and B on
     different polygons, where the distance from A to B is less than
     epsilon and strictly greater than 0. Sort the pairs. Merge the
     smallest distance (move in a globally constant direction). Repeat
     until there are no candidate points. It is not obvious that this
     terminates: Though we remove the pair from immediate consideration
     by making the points distance 0, this may cause A or B to become
     closer to a different point, and then merged with it. After merging
     we should fix both points permanently so that we never move them
     again (only move other nodes TO them). This is very similar now to
     the algorithm above, except that we are forced a certain order
     for A,B and C,D based on their distance (and ties broken by some
     global criteria) and refuse to merge two equivalence classes when
     the classes contain points from the same polygon.

     Actually, simpler still. Start with singleton equivalence
     classes. Merge compatible classes whose canonical representatives
     are within epsilon, in order sorted by distance (this includes
     zero-distances), and with ties broken by some global criteria
     (lexicographically, y coordinate then x coordinate). Set the
     canonical representative to the centroid of all merged points.
     (Or just to the smallest element?) This clearly always terminates
     because each step reduces the finite number of classes by one.

(* The broad-phase is used for computing pairs and performing volume queries

  (* A broadphase keeps track of a bunch of objects in 2D space (given
     axis-aligned bounding boxes) and lets you move them around. It
     supports the query and ray_cast operations from DynamicTree
     as well as a function that applies a callback to each pair of
     objects that might be (newly) colliding. *)

     Query an AABB for overlapping proxies. The callback

  (* ray_cast broadphase callback { p1, p2, max_fraction }

     Ray-cast against the proxies in the broad phase; same as the
     embedded dynamic tree. This relies on the callback to perform an
     exact ray-cast in the case were the proxy contains a shape. The
     callback also performs the collision filtering. This has
     performance roughly equal to k * log(n), where k is the number of
     collisions and n is the number of proxies in the tree.

     The input ray extends from p1 to p1 + maxFraction * (p2 - p1).
     The callback is called for each proxy that is hit by the ray. A return
     value of 0.0 means to stop. *)

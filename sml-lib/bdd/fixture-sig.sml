(* Rigid bodies are made up of fixtures, which are shapes with some
   physical properties like density and friction.

   In BoxDiaDia this signature is used twice: Once transparently for
   the internal BDDFixture structure, which clients should ignore, and
   once abstractly for the final client interface.

  (* Port note: Corresponds to DynamicTreeNode in b2dynamictree.h.
     I decided to use more idiomatic SML instead of the hand-written
     allocator in Box2D, since it's not clear it'd be faster than
     a good generational gc.

     PERF: As I worked through it I realized there are some representation
     invariants that could be enforced with types, which would make the
     code clearer and would remove some of the awkward re-testing !! stuff.
     It deserves another pass. *)

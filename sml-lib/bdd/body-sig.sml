(* Rigid bodies.

   Port note: I renamed functions like is_bullet to get_bullet to
   match with the style of the others, since there doesn't seem to be
   any advantage of irregularity.

   In BoxDiaDia this signature is used twice: Once transparently for
   the internal BDDBody structure, which clients should ignore, and
   once abstractly for the final client interface.

     if you need to set some fixture parameters, like friction.
     Otherwise you can use the simpler function below. If the

     mass of the body. Contacts are not created until the next time
     step. May not be called during callbacks! *)

     will automatically adjust the mass of the body if the body is
     dynamic and the fixture has positive density. All fixtures
     attached to a body are implicitly destroyed when the body is
     destroyed. May not be called during callbacks! *)

     Set the world position of the body's origin and its angle in
     radians. This breaks any contacts and wakes the other bodies.

     not participate in collisions, ray-casts, or queries.

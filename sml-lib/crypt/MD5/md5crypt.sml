(* This is based on PAM's md5_crypt. The code is in the public domain,

   FYI, this algorithm is completely screwed up. I wouldn't be
   surprised if all of this nonsense actually reduces the security as
   compared to just doing a single pass of MD5. What were they
   thinking? *)

     I think the guy who wrote this meant to increment j;
     as it is, it only uses the first character of final
     (which was just zero-filled???) and pw, adding 0 each time.
     Anyway, we have to implement what he has, not what he
     meant. =)

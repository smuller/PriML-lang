textformat is a metautility for generating human-readable and editable
text files that can be transformed to and from SML data structures. It
includes a compiler, tfcompiler, that turns description files (.tfdesc) into
standalone SML that contains a predictable API based on that description,
including ways to read and write the textfile format.

Basically you use it like this:

 - Write a file like data.tfdesc that describes your data.

 - Run tfcompiler (in this directory) on data.tfdesc to generate a
   single standalone SML file called data-tf.sml. This code only
   requires the SML Basis so you can just include it in any project.
   You'd usually build this step into a makefile rule that depends on
   tfcompiler.exe; this directory contains an example.

 - Convert your own internal data structures to the types defined in
   data-tf.sml, or just use them directly if they are suitable. Each
   of the types can be turned into a string and written to a file and
   vice versa and so on. See the API reference below.

Comparison:

 - Google Protocol Buffers are nice, but the binary format is completely
   uneditable and the text format is way too verbose. They also are more
   suitable for curly-style languages. Someone should make a protocol
   buffer implemetation for SML though, maybe me.

 - It is not XML because XML is awful in so many ways. You can use the
   XML parser in ../files/xml. Good luck.

Description language reference:

   A description file contains a series of messages. Each message contains
   a series of fields. Here's an example:

   message V (vertex) =
     field name : string
     field c (coords) : int * int
     field g (neighbors) : int list

   (* Graphs are made up of vertices. *)
   message G (graph) =
     field vs (vertices) : vertex list
       hint vertical
     field name : string option
     field f (finished) : bool

   SML-style comments are allowed anywhere.

   The first message is compiled to a type called vertex in SML. The
   character V is used to name a structure with utilities for the type,
   the constructor in the type (which is always a datatype with a single
   arm containing a record of the fields) and in the serialized format.
   The type name in parentheses doesn't affect the serialization format.
   
   Each field in a message corresponds to a field in the record of that
   datatype. The vertex type becomes

      datatype vertex = V of {
        name : string,
        coords : int * int,
        neighbors: int list
      }

   Again, the names in parentheses only affect the generated code's API,
   not the serialization format. You can safely change the name of a field
   at any time. The tags "name", "c", and "g" are used in the serialization
   format to identify that field. If a parenthesized name isn't used, the
   tag becomes the name as well. Tags have to be unique, of course, as
   well as names.

   The hint keyword is intended to provide hints to the compiler or API
   without affecting the semantics. Currently the only supported hint is
   on a field: vertical. If you write "hint vertical" after a field, then
   any list in that message will be output with newlines instead of spaces
   separating the elements. This is useful on a toplevel message that
   contains a long list of submessages. The intention is that the compiler
   be somewhat heuristic about this in the future, without sacrificing
   performance. It should also indent nested lists properly.

   Not all SML types are supported. Currently allowed are int, string,
   bool, tuples, lists, and options. It makes sense to add some more base
   types like char and real. It is not the intention to support all SML
   types.

Design considerations:

 - This is not a general serialization format; you will often need to
   do additional processing to transform to your own internal SML
   representation.

 - Backwards and forwards compatibility are supported, like in protocol
   buffers, by having the description include the names of the tags.
   Unlike protocol buffers, we don't support round-trip compatibility.
   If you parse it, you discard the fields that you don't understand.

 - It's very important that the generated code by completely standalone
   and not require anything other than the well-supported subset of the
   Standard Basis library. This is so that it can be easily dropped
   into an SML program without adding dependencies or interfering with
   its compilation management system.

 - The text format is designed to support efficient diffs and feasible
   merges in revision control systems, yay.

 - When possible I favor simplicity of usage over stuff like complexity
   of the internal code or performance.

 - When possible I favor performance of the generated code over
   simplicity of its internals.

 - Things are assumed to fit in memory and there's no support for
   recovering from corruption.


API reference:

   Each message has a structure whose name is the token for that message
   (typically this is a single capital letter). It looks like this:

   structure V : sig
     (* To facilitate functorization or other generated code. *)
     type t = vertex
     (* Serialize to the string representation. *)
     val tostring : t -> string
     (* Deserialize, or raise Parse *)
     val fromstring : string -> t
     (* Deserialize or return NONE *)
     val maybefromstring : string -> t option

     (* Write the serialized data over the named file. *)
     val tofile : string -> t -> unit
     (* Read from the file, raising Parse or IO exceptions on failure *)
     val fromfile : string -> t
     (* Read from the file, returning NONE if the contents can't be
        parsed. Still returns regular IO exceptions on file issues. *)
     val maybefromfile : string -> t option

     (* The default instance of this message; see below. *)
     val default : t
   end

Format reference:

   A message is not delimited (though when it is contained in a parent
   message, it is); it is just its series of fields. Every field and
   message in a description has a unique token; by convention the
   messages are a single capital letter and the fields a single
   lowercase letter (but it can be anything).

   A field is encoded by its token followed by the data it contains.
   Because we need to skip fields we don't understand, the data is
   in a format that is self-delimiting.

   Ints are encoded as decimal numbers. Negative numbers have a leading -.
   Strings are encoded as "quoted data" which may include escaped bytes,
   always written \NN where NN is two hexadecimal digits.
   Lists are enclosed in square brackets and separated by whitespace.
   Tuples are encoded the same way as lists.
   An optional type is written the same way, with the expectation that
   there is just zero or one element. If there is more than one element,
   parsing succeeds and ignores all but the first. 
   A sub-message is written as a curly brace {, then the token representing
   that message, then the message as here, then the closing brace }.

   (This is not yet implemented:)
   When the text file format is output, fields with the following values
   may not be encoded as anything (the field simply doesn't appear):
     List []
     Tuple ()
     Option NONE

   Note that this is not hereditary: A list of 5 NONEs is still written
   as [[], [], [], [], []].

   At parse time, there may be missing fields. This happens if the
   description does not match the version used to generate the textfile
   data, or in the cases above. Each type has a default value which
   is assumed if the field isn't found.

     int         0
     string      ""
     list        []
     option      NONE
   
   For tuples, each element is given its default value, inductively.
   For messages, the default instance of the message. In this, each
   field has its default value given inductively. This default instance
   is also accessible in the API.

   Since any field may be missing, the empty string parses as the
   default instance of every message.

   It is illegal (a parse error) for a field to appear multiple times
   in the same message.

   Whitespace basically never matters, except inside of strings and
   when separating tokens from integers, since a token may end
   with digits.

   TODO: 
     - Reject programs at tfcompiler time that contain impossible cyclic
       references. These currently produce SML code that doesn't compile.
     - Implement the representation optimization where we don't output
       a field with certain default values at all.
     - Human-readable debug output (though we should strive to make the
       text format itself pretty readable...)
     - Could make the parsed description available at runtime;
       maybe some limited reflection is possible.
     - Improve the quality of layout, especially with hints. List fields
       should be indented, etc.
     - More base types like char, intinf, and real. If adding intinf,
       insist that the generated code does not contain references to
       intinf unless the tf description does.

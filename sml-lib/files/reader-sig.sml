(* A reader allows the extraction of vectors of characters from
   arbitrary points. We can think of it as an abstract interface to
   files on disk or in memory. This is intended to work around the
   bizarre omission in the BinIO basis structure of a way to seek
   arbitrarily in a file.

   The reader type is a record of all of the operations you can perform
   on it (like an object). All readers have the same type.

   The reader structure includes functions that generate readers from
   files or CharVector.vectors in memory. Recall that
   CharVector.vector is the same type as string.

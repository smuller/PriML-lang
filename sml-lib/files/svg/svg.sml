    (* PERF:

       The SVG spec has an annoying problem here. The string ".5" is a
       valid fractional constant, even if preceded by "0". That means
       that "0.5" has two parses: as [integer 0, fractional .5] and
       [fractional 0.5]. The spec remarks that the BNF productions
       must "consume as much ... as possible", but this does not do
       much to fix the ambiguity. The BNF for number says (int |
       float); if we try int first we consume the 0 and that is as
       much as possible. If we try float first then we consume the
       whole thing and that is as much as possible. So you say the
       rule is, we should parse as much of the input as possible,
       prefering float? Then let's think about a series of numbers
       (which is a simplification of something that really occurs,
       which is a series of number pairs). Now if we follow the
       int-then-float path we consume the entire input, and if we
       follow the float path we consume the entire input. How do we
       know which one to follow? Well, in the ambiguous grammar we
       have to give some preference to one of the paths. An obvious
       way to do this would be to try them in order and only backtrack
       if we get stuck later. (This is precisely what would happen by
       transcribing the BNF into parser combinators directly.)
       Unfortunately, the spec actually gives number as (int | float),
       suggesting that we should prefer to parse a leading int over a
       leading float. However, in the text it gives the example "M
       0.6.5" and indicates that this must parse as the coordinates
       "0.6","0.5" (not "0", "0.6" as the prefix; not "0.0" (in the
       grammar there do not need to be any digits after the decimal
       point either) float "0.6" as the prefix; nor "0.0", "6.5",
       etc.). I take this to mean that we should prefer to parse a
       floating point constant over an integer. Fine. There's no clear
       message on whether
            M 0.6.5 1 z
       should parse (it has at least one legal parse as M 0.0 6 0.5 1
       z). This code will parse it after backtracking, which seems to
       be the only sensible answer. (XXX: actually, it appears that it
       rejects that currently. I'm not going to try to track down this
       "bug".) This can mean some mega backtracking, though. It might
       make sense to figure out what they really mean and hand-write a
       greedy parser for performance and compatibility. *)

(* This is a simple, incorrect XML stream processor. It is designed to

   remove unnecessary fields and tags, in order to make it more
   efficient to store them (or possible to open them with fxlib).

   Assumes the XML is a simple (undescribed) subset of XML and valid.
   Assumes each tag or chunk of text all fits in RAM at once.

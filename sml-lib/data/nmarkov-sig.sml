     observed after the end symbol. This function takes a string,
     observes its first symbol after a state of N 'begin' symbols,
     then its second symbol after a state of N-1 'begin' symbols and
     the first symbol of the string, etc. It observes the end symbol
     once, with the length-n tail of the string (or padded with
     'begin' symbols if shorter than n) as the preceding state. The
     same weight is used for each observation. *)

  (* Produces a stream of the most probable observations ending with a
     certain symbol. The expected way for this to be used is for the
     symbol to be the end symbol sentinel, and the start state to be n
     copies of begin_symbol, following the convention of
     observe_weighted_string. In that case the result is a stream
     (infinite if there are any loops, which is typical) of words,
     ordered from most to least probable, along with their
     probabilities in (0, 1]. The end symbol is not included in the
     list, since it is usually a sentinel and would be included in
     any path anyway.

     If the n-Markov chain contains a cycle where every transition is
     probability 1, then the stream may loop forever without returning
     an answer. This will never be the case if the n-Markov chain was
     constructed only by calls to observe_weighted_string.

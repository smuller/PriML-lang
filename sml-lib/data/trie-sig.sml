(* A trie is a data structure that efficiently stores a set of strings
   (over an arbitrary alphabet) with associated data. It allows efficient
   queries (or traversals) of the set on prefixes of strings.

   The trie is built as a functor (TrieFn) over the argument signature
   TRIEARG below. The structure Trie is also supplied with char = Char.char
   and string = String.string, since this is a very common case *)

    (* maps strings over char to 'a *)
    type 'a trie

    (* new empty trie *)
    val new : unit -> 'a trie

    (* retrieve the value at the root of the trie (empty string) *)
    val value : 'a trie -> 'a option

    (* same as insertwith #2 *)
    val insert : 'a trie -> string -> 'a -> unit
    (* insertwith combine t key value
       inserts key into the trie t. If the key is not already present,
       associate the given value. If it is present with value 'old',
       associate the value combine(old, value).

       Insertion is approximately linear in the radix of char times
       the length of the string being inserted.

  (* It's beautiful!

     At every step we're looking at a series of transitions we might
     make. Each one can either immediately produce an output (because
     it's for the end_symbol) or it can result in a recursive call,
     which also produces output. The end_symbol one can be modeled as
     a stream consisting of a single element. So, look at the head of
     each stream. We need to be careful not to loop forever in doing
     so. So what we'll really do is binary search for answers with
     value greater than some p (strictly less than 1). This can only
     loop in situations where there is a cycle where all transitions
     have probability 1, because all other cycles eventually fall
     below any finite probability.

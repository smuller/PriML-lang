  (* A substitution consists of two operations to be carried out on a de
     Bruin index.

     If the index is less than 'skip', it is unaffectd. When we push a
     substitution into a binder, we increment its skip, since it
     cannot have any effect on that bound variable. (If it is not less
     than skip, we subtract skip from it before indexing into the
     vector. Otherwise, the first skip elements of the replacement
     vector are always wasted.)

     This subtracted index is either in the domain of the
     substitution, or too high (larger than or equal to the length of
     the vector). If it is too high we return the index plus 'up'. (Up
     is always at least as large as the length of the vector.) When a
     substitution is pushed under a binder, we apply to its codomain a
     new substitution 'up' because any de Bruin indices in there now
     look past the binder we've just pushed it under.

     Otherwise, we simply select the element from the substitution
     vector. The vector [t0, t1, t2 ... tn] is taken to mean t0/0,
     t1/1, t2/2 ... tn/n and the identity for any other index. *)

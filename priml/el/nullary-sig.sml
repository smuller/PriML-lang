    exception Nullary of string

    (* rewrites datatype declarations and constructor uses
       to support nullary constructors (no "of") and
       non-polymorphic datatypes.

       datatype t =
          A of int
        | B

        - becomes -

       datatype () t =
          A of int
        | B

       and patterns

       case e of
          B => e'

        - become -

       case e of
          B() => e'

       where B is an App pattern applied to nuthin' (not
       writable in the concrete syntax.)

       occurrences of the type t become (()t) (not writable in the
       concrete syntax -- that's TApp(nil, TVar "t").

       The rest of the compiler assumes this translation has
       been done. *)
    (* XXX5 because this is not a whole-program translation, it is
       important to note that imports don't know that they should be
       nullary translated. This usually doesn't come up. *)
